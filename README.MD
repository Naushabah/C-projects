# 🎯 Guess the Number Game (C Language)

This is a simple terminal-based game written in **C**, where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts.

## 🧠 How It Works

- The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- You have to guess the number.
- After each guess, the program tells you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- The game continues until you guess the correct number.
